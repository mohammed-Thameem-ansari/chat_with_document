Chat with Document
chat_with_document is an innovative application that enables users to interact with and extract information from documents using cutting-edge AI technologies. This project leverages natural language processing and document parsing to create a seamless experience for users seeking to understand and query their documents efficiently.

Features
Document Parsing: Ability to parse and read various document formats (PDF, text, etc.).
AI-powered Queries: Interact with your document by asking questions in natural language and get accurate responses.
Generative AI Integration: Uses AI models for document-based information extraction and natural language understanding.
Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Streamlit
Libraries: google-generativeai, python-dotenv, langchain, pyPDF2, faiss-cpu, langchain_google_genai
API: Google API (for integration with generative AI models)
Deployment: Local deployment (plan for future deployment on cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku)
Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to get your environment up and running:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/mohammed-Thameem-ansari/chat_with_document.git
cd chat_with_document
2. Create a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv .venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

bash
Copy
Edit
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy
Edit
source .venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt is not available, you can install dependencies manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install streamlit google-generativeai python-dotenv langchain pyPDF2 faiss-cpu langchain_google_genai
4. Set up the API Key
Make sure to create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your Google API key:

makefile
Copy
Edit
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
5. Run the Application
Once the environment is set up, you can run the application:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
This will start the app, and you can interact with the document from the browser.

Usage
Upload a document to the system.
Ask questions related to the document in natural language.
The AI model will extract relevant information from the document and return answers.
